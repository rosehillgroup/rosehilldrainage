RDS Grip Drain Ð 20-Year Lifecycle Cost & Performance ReportThis report provides a detailed analysis of the Rosehill RDS Grip Drain as an engineered solution for rural surface water management. Based on physical testing and financial modelling, the report compares two RDS Grip configurations against traditional grip drains over a 100km rural road network.Overview of Grip Drains Across the UK NetworkGrip drains are shallow channels cut across roadside verges to redirect surface water into adjacent ditches. They are a key component of rural drainage, typically spaced every 10Ð30 metres along the verge of rural roads. With approximately 313,500 miles of rural roads in the UK, and assuming an average of 1,000 grips per mile, there are potentially over 300 million individual grip drains across the national network.Local authorities are responsible for maintaining their regional networks. A rural council with 100 miles (160 km) of classified roads may manage over 50,000 grip drains. Maintenance regimes vary, but in many cases, annual / biannual cleaning or inspection of rural grips and Re-cutting or re-forming (i.e., re-trenching) typically occurs every 5Ð10 years, depending on silt buildup and erosion. This is to restore function and prevent localised flooding and represents a significant ongoing cost and labour burden, often absorbing seasonal budgets.1. Independent Testing Ð Particle Retention & FlowTesting based on ASTM D5101 standards demonstrates the RDS system remains permeable even under heavy sediment load. In China clay testing, water continued to pass through despite visible particle migration, indicating self-cleansing flow paths. In silty sand conditions, the unit maintained consistent permeability, reinforcing its suitability for minimal or zero maintenance.2. Product Configurations Compared¥ Two RDS Grip Drain configurations were analysed:* RDS 100mm unit (200mm wide ? 1m long): £55 per unit, engineered for zero intervention over 20+ years.Both options were compared against traditional trench-formed grips with national standard practice: annual / biannual cleaning or inspection of rural grips and Re-cutting or re-forming (i.e., re-trenching) typically occurs every 5Ð10 years, depending on silt buildup and erosion.* Annual maintenance is standard, with minor works yearly and major re-trenching cycles every 10 years.* For a 100 km rural network (Å30,000 grips), at even £10/m per bi- annual visit, this costs £300,000 every 2 years on reactive cleaning, not including deeper rework.* RDS Grip Drain (100?mm) is designed to eliminate all routine maintenance, delivering significant budget relief, zero road disruption, and consistent performance over 20 years.4. Maintenance & Performance Insights¥ Traditional grips require at inspection every 2 years and re-trenching every 5-10 years, involving excavation, spoil removal, and traffic control.¥ The RDS 100mm Grip Drain unit has been independently tested and maintains high permeability even under high silt loads.¥ No scheduled maintenance is required over 20 years, significantly reducing operational costs and labour resource useIndustry Standard Maintenance Cycles for Traditional GripsLocal authorities across the UK typically maintain verge grip drains on an annual or biennial basis to manage runoff and reduce flood risk. The following table summarises current practices among several councils:CouncilGrip Maintenance FrequencyDevon County CouncilAnnually (cleared every year)Bath & North East Somerset CouncilAnnuallySurrey County CouncilEvery 1Ð2 years depending on priority areaWhile deep re-cutting (re-trenching) is typically carried out every 5Ð10 years, surface-level clearance of grips is often performed annually. This recurring cost places significant strain on rural highways budgets.7. Cost Avoidance with RDS Grip DrainAssuming a 1 km rural road network with 300 traditional grips:¥ Regular cleaning at £10/grip = £3,000 year ¥ 5 year re-trenching cycle at £20/grip =£6,000 (amortised)¥ Combined traditional average = £4,200/yearBy contrast, the RDS 100mm unit:¥ Requires no scheduled maintenance over 20 years¥ Has a one-off installation cost with material of £19,500 ¥ Results in average cost of £975/yearThis equates to annual savings of £3,375 per 1KM of rural road network (76% reduction), plus additional gains from avoided traffic disruption, plant usage, and carbon emissions.
